# Project-Envipco
This is a C++ implementation of Reverse Vending Machine <br />
This code has the following primary operations: <br />
     - Collect and count Cans and Bottles (ignore other insertions)<br />
     - Print transaction details to the customer <br />
     - Admin control -> Need PIN to access. All changes will be saved in .txt file <br />
          - Change PIN <br />
          - Change price per Bottle and Can <br />
          - Information of total bottles/cans collected and money paid in all the transactions <br />
          - Clear the above details <br />

Script initialization: Run main.cpp file  <br />
                       current PIN: 2345  <br />
Any changes to admin control parameters can be done while running the script, without needing to change code.
