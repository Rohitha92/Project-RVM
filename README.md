# Project-Envipco
This is a C++ implementation of Reverse Vending Machine <br />
This code has the following primary operations: <br />
     1. Collect and count Cans and Bottles (ignore other insertions)<br />
     2. Print transaction details to the customer <br />
     3. Admin control -> Need PIN to access. All changes will be saved in .txt file <br />
          * Change PIN 
          * Change price per Bottle and Can 
          * Information of total bottles/cans collected and money paid in all the transactions 
          * Clear the above details 

Script initialization: Run main.cpp file  <br />
                       current PIN: 2345  <br />
Any changes to admin control parameters can be done while running the script, without needing to change code.
